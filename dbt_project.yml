# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In dbt, the default materialization for a model is a view. This means, when you run 
# `dbt run` or `dbt build`, all of your models will be built as views in your data platform. 
# The configuration below will override this setting for models in the `codes` folder to 
# instead be materialized as tables. These settings can be overridden in individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

models:
  dbt-test-ajinkya:
    codes:  # This should match the subdirectory name under the "models" folder.
      +schema: devdw  # Specify the schema where models will be created.
      +materialized: table  # Optional: Set default materialization for this folder.
